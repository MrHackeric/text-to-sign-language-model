# Text-to-Sign Language Model

This project focuses on training a machine learning model to convert textual data into sign language. The model is built using Python and popular ML libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.

### Additional Considerations:

1. **Training Script (`train.py`)**: This script should include functionality for saving checkpoints during training and logging metrics (e.g., using `TensorBoard` or `WandB`).

2. **Model Saving**: Ensure the model gets saved in `models/final/` once training is complete. Checkpoints should be saved in `models/checkpoints/`.

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: The YAML configuration files (`configs/`) allow easy tweaking of model architectures and training parameters without changing the Python scripts directly.

4. **Tests**: You should write unit tests for each script in the `tests/` directory to ensure your preprocessing, training, evaluation, and prediction scripts work as expected.

This directory and file structure, along with the detailed `README.md`, provides a clean and organized environment for training and deploying machine learning models in Python.
